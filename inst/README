# Usage

You must create a environment variable containing your crantastic API key before
using this package. Log in on http://crantastic.org to get your API key, then
you can add this line to your Rprofile file:

    Sys.setenv(CRANTASTIC_TOKEN="your-api-key-here")

Or you could set the variable in your shell configuration.
